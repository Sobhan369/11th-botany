This chapter introduces the internal structure of higher plants. The study of internal structure and organisation of plant is called Plant Anatomy (_Gk: Ana_\= _as under; temnein_ \= _to cut_). Plants have cells as the basic unit. The cells are organised into tissues. The tissues in turn are organised into organs. The different organs in a plant have different internal structures. It is studied by means of dissection and microscopic examination.

A Tissue is a group of cells that are alike in origin, structure and function. The study of tissues is called Histology. A plant is made up of different types of tissues.

There are two principal groups:

2. Permanent tissues
