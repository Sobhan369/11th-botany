# Redox Reactions

`formulae`
`NAD1 1 2e - 1 2H1 NADH 1 H1`

`FAD 1 2e- 1 2H1 FADH2`

When NAD1 (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide-oxidised form) and FAD (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide) pick up electrons and one or two hydrogen ions (protons), they get reduced to NADH 1 H1 and FADH2 respectively. When they drop electrons and hydrogen off they go back to their original form. The reaction in which NAD1 and FAD gain (reduction) or lose (oxidation) electrons are called **redox reaction** (Oxidation reduction reaction). These reactions are important in cellular respiration.
