## Taxonomic Hierarchy

Taxonomic hierarchy was introduced by Carolus Linnaeus. It is the arrangement of various taxonomic levels in descending order starting from kingdom up to species.

**Kingdom** is the highest level or rank of the classification. Example: Plantae

| **Rank**                 | **Ending** | **Example**         |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Kingdom                  | -          | Plantae             |
| Phylum = Division        | -phyta     | Magnoliophyta       |
| Subphylum = Sub division | -phytina   | Magnoliophytina     |
| Class                    | -opsida    | Asteropsida         |
| Sub class                | -idea      | Asteridea           |
| Order                    | -ales      | Asterales           |
| Suborder                 | -ineae     | Asterineae          |
| Family                   | -aceae     | Asteraceae          |
| Sub family               | -oideae    | Asteroideae         |
| Tribe -                  | eae        | Heliantheae         |
| Genus                    | -          | Helianthus          |
| Sub genus                | -          | _Helianthus_        |
| subg.                    | -          | _Helianthus_        |
| Series                   | -          | _Helianthus_        |
| Species                  | -          | _Helianthus annuus_ |
