# Need for Classification

- Understanding the classification of organisms can give an insight into other fields and has significant practical value.

- Classification helps us to know about different taxa, their phylogenetic relationship and exact position.

- It helps to train the students of plant sciences with regard to the diversity of organisms and their relationship with other biological branches.
