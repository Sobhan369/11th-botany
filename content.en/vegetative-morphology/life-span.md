## Life Span

Based on life span plants are classified into 3 types. They are annuals, biennials and perennials

**I. Annuals**

A plant that completes its life cycle in one growing season. Example: Maize, Water melon, Groundnut, Rice.

**II. Biennials**

A plant that lives for two seasons, growing vegetatively during the first season and flowering and fruiting during the second season. Example: Carrot, Radish, Cabbage.

**III. Perennials**

A plant that grows for many years that flowers and set fruits for several seasons during the life span. When they bear fruits every year, they are called **polycarpic perennials.** Example: Mango, Sapota. Some plants produce flowers and fruits only once and die after a vegetative growth of several years. These plants are called **monocarpic perennials**. Example: _Bambusa_, _Agave, Musa._
