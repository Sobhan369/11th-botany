# Accessory organs

Arrangement of whorls
The position of perianth (sepals, petals, tepals) parts relative to one another is called **perianth arrangement**.

**1. Cyclic or whorled:** All the floral parts are arranged in definite whorls. Example: _Brassica._

**2. Acyclic or spiral:** The floral parts are arranged in spirals on the elongated fleshy torus. Example: _Magnolia_.

**3. Spirocyclic or hemicyclic**: Some parts are in whorls and others parts are in spirals. Example:_Annona, Polyalthia_

## Calyx

Calyx protects the flower in bud stage. Outermost whorl of flower is calyx. Unit of calyx is sepal. Normally green in colour.

**1. Fusion**:

**a. Aposepalous** (polysepalous): The flower with distinct sepals. Example: _Brassica, Annona._

**b. Synsepalous:** The flower with united or fused sepals. Example: _Hibiscus_.

**2. Duration of floral parts:**

What is the green part of brinjal fruit? Have you seen similar to this in any other fruits?

**a. Caducous or fugacious calyx**: Calyx that withers or falls off during the early development stage of flower. Example: _Papaver_.

**b. Deciduous:**
Calyx that falls soon afterthe opening of flower (anthesis) Example: Nelumbo.

**c. Persistant**:
Calyx that persists and continues to be along with the fruit and forms a cup at the base of the fruit. Example: Brinjal.

**d. Accrescent**: Calyx that is persistent, grows along with the fruit and encloses the fruit either completely or partially. Example: _Physalis_.

**3. Shapes of calyx** Have you noticed the shoe flowerâ€™s calyx? It is bell shaped called **Campanulate**. The fruiting calyx is urn shaped in _Withania_ and it is called **urceolate**. In _Datura_ calyx is tube like and it is known as **tubular**. Two lipped calyx is present _in Ocimum_. Sometimes calyx is coloured and called **petaloid.** Example: _Saraca_ and _Mussanda_. In Tridax, calyx is modified into hair like structures are called pappus.

## Corolla

Corolla is the most attractive part in majority of the flowers and is usually brightly coloured. Corolla helps to display the flower and attracts the pollinators.

**1. Fusion:**

**a. Apopetalous (polypetalous)**: Petals are distinct. Example: _Hibiscus_.

b. **Sympetalous (gamopetalous)**: Petals are fused. Example: _Datura_.

## Perianth

Can you recall the term homochlamydeous? Undifferentiated calyx and corolla in a flower is called **perianth**. Each member is called **tepal**. If the tepals are distinct they are called **Apotepalous** (Polyphyllous). Example: _Allium sativum._ Fused tepals are called **Syntepalous**_._ (Gamophyllous). Example: Allium cepa.

**Lodicule :** Reduced scale like perianth in the members of Poaceae is called lodicule.

## Aestivation:

Arrangement of sepals and petals in the flower bud is said to be aestivation.
