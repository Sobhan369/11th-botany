Flowers have been a universal cultural object for millennia. They are an important aesthetic element in everyday life, and have played a highly symbolic role in our culture throughout the ages. Exchange of flowers marks respect, affection, happiness, and love. However, the biological purpose of the flower is very different from the way we use and perceive. Flower helps a plant to reproduce its own kind. This chapter discusses flowers, their arrangement, fruits and seeds which are the reproductive units of a plant.

**Floriculture**

Floriculture is a branch of Horticulture. It deals with the cultivation of flowers and ornamental crops. The Government of India has identified floriculture as a sunrise industry and accorded the status of 100% export oriented. Agriculture and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority (APEDA) is responsible for export promotion of agricultural and horticultural products from India.
