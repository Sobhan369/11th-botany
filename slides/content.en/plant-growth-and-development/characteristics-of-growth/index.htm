    <!-- Slide 3: Overview of Plant Life Cycle -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Overview of Plant Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>Highlight the main stages of a plant's life cycle: Germination, Seedling growth, Vegetative growth, Reproductive growth, Senescence and death.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 4: Germination -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Germination</h2>
        <p>Define germination. Explain the environmental factors that influence germination. Include visuals of seeds germinating.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 5: Seedling Growth -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Seedling Growth</h2>
        <p>Discuss the emergence of the seedling from the soil. Mention the development of roots and shoots. Include images comparing seedlings at different stages.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 6: Vegetative Growth -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Vegetative Growth</h2>
        <p>Explain the phase of vegetative growth. Highlight the development of leaves, stems, and branches. Discuss the role of photosynthesis in this stage.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 7: Reproductive Growth -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Reproductive Growth</h2>
        <p>Introduce the phase of reproductive growth. Discuss the formation of flowers and the reproductive organs. Explain the pollination and fertilization processes.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 8: Environmental Factors Affecting Growth -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Environmental Factors Affecting Growth</h2>
        <p>Discuss key environmental factors influencing plant growth: Light, Water, Temperature, Nutrients. Explain how these factors interact to determine growth patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 9: Hormonal Regulation -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Hormonal Regulation</h2>
        <p>Briefly introduce plant hormones (auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene). Explain their roles in plant growth and development.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Slide 10: Adaptations to Environmental Stress -->
    <section data-auto-animate data-transition="zoom">
        <h2>Adaptations to Environmental Stress</h2>
